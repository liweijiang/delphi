As AI systems become increasingly powerful and pervasive, there are growing concerns about machines’ morality—or lack thereof. Existing AI systems deployed to millions of users are already making decisions loaded with moral implications, yet, moral questions are among the most intensely debated the world over. This poses a seemingly impossible challenge: teaching machines morality, while humanity continues to grapple with it.

To explore this challenge, we introduce Delphi, an experimental framework based on deep neural networks and trained to predict human moral judgments. Empirical results shed novel insights on the promises and limits of machine ethics. Delphi demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in the face of novel ethical situations, while off-the-shelf neural network models exhibit markedly poor judgment, confirming the need for explicitly teaching machines a moral sense.

Yet, Delphi is not perfect, exhibiting susceptibility to pervasive biases and inconsistencies. Despite these shortcomings, we demonstrate positive use cases of Delphi, including using it as a component model within other imperfect AI systems. Importantly, we interpret the operationalization
